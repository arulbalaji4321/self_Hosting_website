Welcome to my personal space, a haven away from the noise and manipulation of social media. Here, I invite those who truly care about me to join me on my life journey, where I share my thoughts on technology, delve into my crazy projects, and explore my hobbies and interests.

Why I Avoid Social Media:

I've made a conscious decision to steer clear of social media platforms. I see them for what they are: modified Skinner boxes designed to manipulate and control us, shaping trends and enforcing herd mentalities. By breaking free from this digital matrix, I reclaim control over my online and offline life.

Embracing Free Thinking:

For people like me, embracing free thinking means rejecting the confines of social media. I believe that true independence and free speech can only thrive when we take back control of our online presence. I carefully curate my media consumption, both online and offline, recognizing that what we perceive as truth may often be distorted, and what's dismissed as conspiracy might hold elements of truth.


In this space, I advocate for thoughtful consumption of media and the pursuit of independent thought, Along with bits and pieces of my life, Tech, Martial Arts, Discipline, stoicism and much more. Adventure Awaits...
