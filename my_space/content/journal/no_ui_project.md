##### NO_UI Project ✨✌️

{{< gap >}}

###### I am presenting you the No UI project for tech savvy people and people who want to be in digial detox, bringing cli environment in Android

{{< gap >}}

I believe, if we dont have UI we wont use phone mindlessly, cuz you have to think and give commands to your phone for every operations.

I have debloated all factory installed bloatwares and social media apps including youtube using adb shell.

cuz I am sick of all this manipulating algorithms.

Levaraged over other opensource projects to create this:

01. termux
02. tgpt
03. ranger
04. ytfzf
05. tmux
06. cmus & cava
07. openssh
08. yt-dlp
09. htop
10. ncdu
11. mupdf
12. fossify gallery
13. Yanrtra Launcher
14. newsboat
15. links

I wrote bash script to connect all this into one part and some config works, yantra has some bugs yet its a nice project.

###### Pros of this project

1. As cli follows unix philosophy, your phone is highly customizable now.
2. Interface is clean and neat, no distractions or anything that hypes your dopamine.
3. No Ads.
4. simple interface like this encourage you to achieve your digital detox goals.
5. shell Automation.
6. Encourage  you to break out of matrix and motivates you to do free thinking cuz you are no longer manipulated by algorithm and you are not following herd mentality anymore.
7. you have huge control on your system. you decide what you consume in internet, not by Algorithms or AI's which was controlled my big tech's.

###### Cons of this project
1. Sophesticated to setup, yet provides you the learning curve about computers.
2. Boring Interface, It depends on eyes of beholder, Tbh boring interface encourages you to use your phone less, hence digital detox is easier to achieve.
3. Complicated system, Again depends on eyes of beholder :) 

Life is now clear and focused, I am having this setup for months, I have migrated some essential google apps like maps and other apps to shelter app from F-Droid to isolate and hibernate them.
