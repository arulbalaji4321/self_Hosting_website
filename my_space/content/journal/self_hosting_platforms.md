##### Why I am Self Hosting my own platforms?

{{< gap >}}

###### Since I decided to come out of Matrix, It pulled me into this rabbit hole.

This is my matrix private chat room.

I have realized. I don't need any softwares that were offered by big tech companies because all the data they collect could be used against us with in
split second.

so i have decided to leverage free and opensource softwares and services to host my own platforms.

##### 3. Media server

Selfhosting your own services. Gives back power to you. you are not with in the matrix anymore.

{{< gap >}}

you are not relying on a company to show mercy on you, you dont have to be worried for your content being deleted. You don't have to be bound to world's rule and change your content based on likes and comments

###### CUZ YOU ARE AT THE PLACE, WHERE YOU CREATE TRENDS RATHER THAN GOING ALONG WITH THE ONE.

##### 5. Wrapper script that leverages rsync to backup data (like Google Drive)

{{< gap >}}

{{< embed-img src="/media/images/my_platform/rsync.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="rsync backup script" >}}

{{< embed-img src="/media/images/my_platform/rsync_done.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="rsync done" >}}

{{< gap >}}

Just a simple wrapper script to iterate through all my directories and do back up for all my data.
